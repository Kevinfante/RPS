This is a Rock, Paper, Scissors project that I have to do for the odin project.
Everything is displayed in the console except the prompt for the user to input what they're going to play.
I couldn't figure out how to keep score or display the winner at the end but I had to move on for now.
it will display the winner of every round as well as what the player selected and the computer selected.
I plan to return to this once I can figure a way to impliment score tracking and final score reporting.

I finally came back to this project and made a few changes:
-incorporated styles to change up the way the page looks
-added some js so that the user no longer has to type their selection, now user must click button
-put up a scoreboard that displays a running score
I was able to get the original game that functioned on cosole to display a winner and total score after five games after all but that was never uploaded onto here because as soon as i figured that out, I went right to adding js until i finished this update. 
the only thing that I wasn't able to figure out was how to add an alert when either win or loss on the table reached five. I'm sure it is not that difficult but at the moment I have not figured it out. Everything else, however, runs smoothly.
