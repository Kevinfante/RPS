This is a Rock, Paper, Scissors project that I have to do for the odin project.
Everything is displayed in the console except the prompt for the user to input what they're going to play.
I couldn't figure out how to keep score or display the winner at the end but I had to move on for now.
it will display the winner of every round as well as what the player selected and the computer selected.
I plan to return to this once I can figure a way to impliment score tracking and final score reporting.
